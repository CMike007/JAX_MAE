# JAX_LOB_Simulation

This project is based on the AlphaTrade code that can be found here:

This project presents an extension to [JAX-LOB](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13289), a framework introduced by Frey et al., and shows how extending it allows a more realistic creation of market dynamics by individually modelling major market participants and their strategies through agent-based models. The study builds on top of the base model by providing an algorithm to synthetically provide level-10 Limit Order Book (LOB) data, the introduction of a new price formation process, as well as a set of heterogeneous set of Reinforcement Learning (RL) trading agents.
